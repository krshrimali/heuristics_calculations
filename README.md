Calculation of Heuristics (Manhattan and SLD) using p5 js

To run this program, open index.html file in your browser, and press ctrl + shift + I, for the console (the outputs are being shown there as of now.)

Select two points, *ENTER* for Manhattan Distance, and *ESCAPE* for SLD (Straight Line Distance/Euclidean Distance). Outputs are shown now on both console as well as the grid.

Suggestions and feedback, welcome!
